# Tutorial

TODO:
* Information on how to call [`generate_point_on_perimeter`](@ref).
* Information on how to call [`generateN_equally_spaced_points`](@ref).
* Plots of different points generated on an ellipse, as part of demonstrating how the above functions work.
* Note on, for ease of use, these generation functions can either be called directly with ellipse parameters such as a, b and Î±, or we can construct an ellipse struct first with those parameters, and use the ellipse struct when calling the generation functions.
